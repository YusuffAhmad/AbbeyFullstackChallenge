# Abbey FullStack Engineer Challenge

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a full-stack application for the Abbey FullStack Engineer Challenge. The application is built using **C#**, **ASP.NET MVC**, and **MySQL** as the database. The solution showcases a working example of authentication, account management, and user relationship functionalities.

### Key Features:
- **Authentication**: Secure login and logout functionalities implemented using ASP.NET Identity, with session handling.
- **Accounts Management**: Users can create and manage their accounts, storing and retrieving specific information related to their profiles.
- **User Relationships**: The application supports connections between users, such as friendships or followers.

This project demonstrates my approach to solving architectural problems and my proficiency with the technologies used. The goal is to provide a functional end-to-end solution that is easy to understand, deploy, and use.

## Technologies Used

- **C#** and **ASP.NET MVC**: For backend development and handling server-side logic.
- **MySQL**: As the relational database for data storage.
- **ASP.NET Identity**: For user authentication and authorization.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For frontend development.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive and consistent UI styling.
- **Entity Framework**: For database operations and ORM.
